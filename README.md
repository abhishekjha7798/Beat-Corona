# Beat-Corona
Simple game where the player has to evade the coronavirus elements present in the game while picking masks, sanitizers and self-quarantine elements.
Together, the world is facing a truly unprecedented situation. The global coronavirus pandemic is affecting our work, our families and also our way of life. First and foremost, our hearts go out to anyone who's been impacted by the virus, either directly or indirectly. We sincerely wish that all those who are sick may recover completely at the earliest. We are truly thankful to the doctors and the healthcare workers who are risking their lives to take care of the people in need. 


While the country is locked down, most of us have a lot of leisure time. Many are complaining that they have nothing much to do in their free time and are getting bored. So, we thought, what can be more enticing and captivating than playing a game that also teaches us how to win this difficult period of time. 

We wanted to reach out and spread awareness among the people about what they should do to protect themselves from the virus. Being Computer Engineers, we thought the easiest possible way to connect to the people is through a simple game that can send a message to the people about the basic precautions and protective measures that they should take against the infamous virus.


Therefore, we have developed this simple game called “Beat Corona” where the player has to evade the coronavirus elements present in the game while picking masks, sanitizers and self-quarantine elements.
